## The Basics

The New Orleans Vacation Planner is a rails-based app that allows users to explore the city virtually and create a customized itinerary of places to visit. Users can browse local landmarks based on category and neighborhood, or browse the full list. If they see a location they like, it can be added to their itinerary and later removed at the discretion. Users may also leave reviews of landmarks and read reviews from others. If a user is familiar with the city, they can register as a guide, allowing them to create and edit new landmarks, neighborhoods, and categories. The app uses omniauth to allow users to sign up and login with their google account.
